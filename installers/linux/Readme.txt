After downloading the USBInstaller/Linux folder open a terminal window in the directory and run the command: 

sudo sh install.sh 

That will create the desktop application named OpenRobertaUSBProgram which can be accessed at usr/share/applications or directly from Ubuntu search by typing the name of the program. 

In order to delete the desktop entry from the applications list, in the same directory, run the command: 

sudo sh uninstall.sh
